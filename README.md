# Sparkify_Project

## Installation:
To run this project you have to install some libraries which are:
1. Pyspark.
2. numpy.
3. matplotlib.
4. dateetime.

## Project Motivation:
In this project we suppose that we have an app called Sparkify which is a music streaming application and I wanted to create a churn prediction system to be able to predict the customers who might churn from the application before they do so that we can take actions to prevent them from churn by:
1. Making targeted offers.
2. Giving them free subscriptions.

## File Descriptions:
This project contains only one jupyter notebook that contains all the code which is trying to answer the questions asked in this project, and it also has the 2022 survey dataset downloaded from Stackoverflow website exported in a csv file and schema file that contains all the columns descriptions and a pdf file that contains the survey with the choices.
