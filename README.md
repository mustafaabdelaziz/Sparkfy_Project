# Sparkify_Project

## Installation:
To run this project you have to install some libraries which are:
1. Pyspark.
2. numpy.
3. matplotlib.
4. dateetime.

## Project Motivation:
In this project we suppose that we have an app called Sparkify which is a music streaming application and I wanted to create a churn prediction system to be able to predict the customers who might churn from the application before they do so that we can take actions to prevent them from churn by:
1. Making targeted offers.
2. Giving them free subscriptions.

## File Descriptions:
This project contains only one jupyter notebook that contains all the code which is used to predict customer churn, and it also has a subset of a greater dataset called sparkify_events_data and that subset of the data is called mini_sparkify_events_data and it's saved into json file format.

## Results:
You can find the results in this post on medium website: https://medium.com/@mustafa.mahmoud_10510/saprkify-customer-churn-prediction-88a478713ed6
